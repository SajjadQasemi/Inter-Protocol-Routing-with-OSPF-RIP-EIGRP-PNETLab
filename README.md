# Inter-Protocol-Routing-with-OSPF-RIP-EIGRP-PNETLab
This project demonstrates an inter-protocol routing design implemented in PNETLab, focusing on seamless communication between multiple routing protocols. OSPF is used as the core routing protocol with a multi-area hierarchical structure, while RIPv2 and EIGRP (AS 100) are integrated at the network edges.
